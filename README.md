This is my golf project, and the first one I plan to work more than one week on. Its very unfinished unpolished but its has alot of the basic systems down.. which was a real struggle.
The basic gist is that you are a crystall ball hired to collect potion ingridents, those being variants of normal fruit( the only one implimented rn is angry banana that increase's your stroke number)
Somehow, however, there seem to random normal fruits scattered around your golf course, collecting these can do bad things like increasing your stroke by one.
If your stroke goes above the limit it resets.
Only mouse controls.
This follows the weeks theme of magic because you're a crystal golf ball trying to collect magic potion ingredients, (more like a magic salad).
Thanks to Sleeping Colossus, their tutorial is really good.
