The basic gist is that you are a crystall ball hired to collect potion ingredients (which are variations of normal fruits.
Somehow, however, there seem to random normal fruits scattered around your golf course, collecting these can do bad things like increasing your stroke by one.
So far the fruits implemented is an angry banana which lowers the fruit you have to collect by one. The normal banana however increases your stroke count by one.
If your stroke goes above the limit it resets the level, or just press the reset buttons.
Two levels so far.
Only mouse controls.
